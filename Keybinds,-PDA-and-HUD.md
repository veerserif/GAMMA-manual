## Mod-specific keybinds
These can be changed in-game by going to the Mod Configuration Menu (MCM), and either selecting the MCM Keybinds tab, or finding the specific mod and changing it through that menu.

| Key | Mod | Action |
|---|---|---|
| B | Weapon Tilt | Raise/tilt weapon |
| Mouse 5 | Free Zoom | Zoom in |
| Z | Patches by Hotkey | Remove/add faction patch |
| Shift + F | Ammo Check | Check ammo in current magazine |
| Shift + F5 | YACS | Use Daddy Token (quicksave away from campfire) |

Ammo Check requires both it and Mags Redux to be activated to work.
