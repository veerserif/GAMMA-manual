S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly introduces a 3D PDA system which G.A.M.M.A. also uses. Instead of having separate "Quest", "Map", "Faction" or similar menu pages, in G.A.M.M.A. all of this is accessed through your PDA, a vital piece of equipment.

# PDA Basics

The PDA is an actual in-game item that **must be equipped** in order to be used. One PDA is given to the player at the beginning of every new game. This is the player's personal PDA and contains information on tasks, explored areas, faction relations and more. Since PDAs count as a piece of electronic equipment, they must also have a working battery inside them to function.

By default, the keybind to bring up the PDA is `Tab`. To "zoom in" for a better view, press the Aim button, `MB2` by default.
