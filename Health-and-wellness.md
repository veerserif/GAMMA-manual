How to stay healthy and happy in the Zone.

# Health and healing

G.A.M.M.A. uses the [Body Health System](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/100-groks-body-health-system-redux-for-151), which drastically changes the way healing and damage is handled. With this mod, being damaged in a certain body part damages that limb's overall health. Increasing limb damage leads to different effects, and is separate from the player's overall health. Healing now requires two components: temporary "first aid" healing, and permanent "post-heal" health.

*All of this information is available on the mod's page.*
