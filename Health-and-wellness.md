How to stay healthy and happy in the Zone.

# Health and healing

G.A.M.M.A. uses the [Body Health System](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/100-groks-body-health-system-redux-for-151), which drastically changes the way healing and damage is handled. With this mod, being damaged in a certain body part damages that limb's overall health. Increasing limb damage leads to different effects, and is separate from the player's overall health. Healing now requires two components: temporary "first aid" healing, and permanent "post-heal" health.

*All of this information is available on the mod's page.*

## Limb damage

Right now, G.A.M.M.A. models damage to the head, torso, left and right arms, and left and right legs.

Low head health produces disorienting visual effects: wobbling screens, fading in and out of blackness, and blurry vision. No head health leads to death.

Low torso health reduces your carry capacity. No torso health leads to death.

Low leg health reduces your movement speed, and trying to sprint will cause general health damage. No leg health in one or both leg stops you from being able to sprint.

Low arm health causes your aim to wobble. No arm health in one arm stops you being able to effectively use two-handed weapons such as most guns, though you can still use pistols and knives. No arm health in both arms stops you from being able to hold a weapon, causing you to drop your equipped weapon.

## Healing

General body health can be recovered by using certain healing items such as first-aid kits. Read an item's tooltips or go into their details page to see exactly how much they heal, at what rate. Standing next to lit campfires also slowly regenerates general body health.

Limb damage must be tended to with yellow first-aid healing items to grant "temporary" health, which is then "fixed" with a post-heal item into regular hitpoints. This "temporary health" will fade over time, dropping back down to your maximum "post-heal" (white) health.

Remember, the sequence of events is: **use a limb first-aid item > use an appropriate post-heal item**. Many post-heal items take a long time to apply, or produce visual effects simulating dizzyness. Therefore it is generally best to wait until you are out of combat before using them.

Not all post-heal items work on all body parts, so read the tooltip carefully before use.

Alternatively, limbs can be healed by paying medics to completely heal you, or by going to sleep. Sleeping does not restore general health, only limb health.

# Hunger and thirst

You must also manage your hunger and thirst while you're in the Zone. Similar to other survival games, you must eat and drink appropriate items. Running low on thirst or hunger gradually damages you over time, and can result in death if you don't deal with the problem.

Simply "use" consumable food or water items to fill up your bar. Remember that different foods and drinks will restore different amounts of your meters, and you may require more than one food item to completely fill up. Eating large, high-calorie foods also tends to increase your tiredness, so eating a big meal before you want to sleep can be a good idea.

Food and drink produced outside of the Zone, such as canned food, MREs and bottled water, will not give you radiation when consuming them. Zone-produced food and drink, such as cooked mutant meat, will give some very slight radiation when eaten. Usually, this can be countered by drinking clean water, smoking cigarettes, or drinking vodka.
