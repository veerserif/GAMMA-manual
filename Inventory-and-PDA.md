# Inventory

The inventory is a vital element of the game and you'll be staring at it a lot. Since progression in G.A.M.M.A. is largely dictated by the gear you have equipped, you will be staring a lot at the stuff you have - or don't.

## Inventory-specific keybinds

Certain keybinds function differently on the inventory screen. By holding down certain modifier keys and mousing over items, players can perform certain quick actions. These keys are marked as `(on hover)`, meaning that they only work if players hover over an item then press that key.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Right click | Open action menu |
| Shift (on hover) | Quick transfer |
| L Ctrl (on hover) | Show stats at 100% condition |
| L Alt (on hover) | Disassembly safety (disabled by default) |

## Items

All items are displayed on the right hand pane. Individual items cannot be reordered, but they can be interacted with by either right-clicking them to open up an action menu, or double-clicking them to perform the default action (e.g. equipping gear, using toolkits).

### Sorting

Items are [sorted from top to bottom](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/sorting-plus):

* Favourited items
* Loadout items (if enabled)
* Magazines (if playing with Mags Redux)
* Weapons (guns, melee weapons, explosives)
* Suits and helmets
* Artifacts (in or out of containers)
* Devices (receivers, detectors etc.)
* Tools, repair kits and other kits
* Medical items
* Food and drink
* Quest items and letters
* Ammunition
* Mutant parts
* Upgrade kits
* Crafting parts and broken items
* Faction patches
* Items set as junk

You can also quick-scroll to these categories by pressing the number keys or clicking the icons at the bottom of the center pane. 

## Equipment

Equipped gear is displayed in the center pane. Each piece of equipped gear must fit in one of the visible slots, which only take certain types of items. 

The body slot is for suits. If the equipped suit has available belt slots, they will be displayed just above the resistances pane - in the above image, no belt slots are available, so there are lock icons on all five possible belt slots. Belt slots can be used to equip armor frames, ballistic plates, or artifacts that are in suitable wearable containers.

The head slot is for helmets and respirators. These provide the majority of your radiation and psy resistance. Different models of masks will have different vision overlays, and may be cleaned if wet or otherwise dirty with the `T` key.

Weapons can be slotted into one of four slots: primary, secondary, melee or vision. Despite the names of the slots, pistols, certain SMGs and melee weapons and binoculars ("one handed weapons") can be equipped to any of the four slots. Guns that need two hands to wield can only be equipped in the primary or secondary weapon slot.

The B6 slot corresponds to the `5` key by default, and is generally kept for bolts or spent shells. These can be thrown to trigger anomalies, enabling players to find safe routes through anomaly fields or trigger anomalies on purpose.

The G4 slot is for grenades and other throwables. Press the `G` key to quick-throw the item in this slot.

The head gear slot is used for headlamps and night-vision goggles. Headlamps are toggled with `L` and night-vision goggles with `N`.

The detector slot is used for RF receivers, anomaly detectors, glowsticks, and flashlights. Detectors can be dual-wielded with one-handed weapons - that is to say, knives, pistols, and bolts/shells.

The PDA slot is only used to equip PDAs.

There are four quick-item slots, F1 to F4. By dragging items to these slots, pressing the associated key will use that item. This is particularly helpful for healing items and other meds. A transparent icon means that there is nothing currently equipped to that slot. By default, F1 uses first-aid kits, F2 for bandages, F3 for army medkits and F4 for morphine.

## Resistances

Underneath the equipment pane and belt slots are bars representing various resistances and meters. In G.A.M.M.A., much like base S.T.A.L.K.E.R., there are seven types of damage (left to right, top to bottom):

* Radiation
* Psy or psychic damage 
* Acid damage
* Impact damage
* Electric damage
* Rupture damage
* Fire damage

Radiation damage is caused by radiation fields and certain artifacts (usually more powerful ones). 

Psy damage comes from psy fields and certain mutants, as well as a certain anomaly. 

Acid, electrical and fire damage are caused by different kinds of anomalies. Specifically:

* Burners and Comets cause fire damage.
* Fruit Punch, Gas and Gas Clouds cause acid damage.
* Electro and Tesla anomalies cause electric damage.

Impact damage comes from certain mutant attacks (anything that looks like a bodyslam, headbutt or charge), certain anomalies, and fall damage. Rupture damage comes from bullets, slashing attacks, and certain anomalies.
