## What is this?

This is a GitHub wiki writeup of existing information about how to play the G.A.M.M.A. modpack. It is not intended to teach you how to install the pack, update it, customize it, or any other technical support. However, for the sake of completeness, there may be an appendix of technical links and FAQs.

Part of the fun of G.A.M.M.A. is figuring out how to do these things for yourself. However, it is a complex game with many interlocking systems. I have tried to be thorough when explaining mechanics, while remaining silent on how, where and when these mechanics actually kick in in-game. Representative screenshots were made using a new character, sticking to the decidedly-beginner Rookie Village.

It is intended as a companion to the Discord-based knowledge channels and to the in-game PDA. You may see repeated information here. This is fine. The guide also assumes you have not changed any default keybinds - if you do you will have to adapt to your own custom keybinds.

## Useful links
The most up-to-date information about installation, mod features, development and other news will always be the official Discord server.
