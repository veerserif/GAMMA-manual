## What is this?

This is a GitHub wiki writeup of existing information about how to play the G.A.M.M.A. modpack. It is not intended to teach you how to install the pack, update it, customize it, or any other technical support. However, for the sake of completeness, there may be an appendix of technical links and FAQs.

It is intended as a companion to the Discord-based knowledge channels and to the in-game PDA. You may see repeated information here. This is fine.
