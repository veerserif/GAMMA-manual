One of G.A.M.M.A.'s core features is its reliance on crafting systems introduced by Anomaly. The main method of progression involves players finding tools and repair parts, scrounging weapons and armor from dead enemies or stashes, then fixing them up to full working condition. Therefore, it is important for you to understand how these systems work in order to make any kind of progress in the game.

# Tools

There are three major categories of crafting gear: **tools**, **kits** and **parts**. 

**Tools** come in five kinds: Basic, Advanced, Expert, Gunsmithing and Drugmaking. There is also a special "tool" which is the Artifact Melter, used specifically for artifact crafting. Each tool type gates crafting of an entire category of recipes - Basic tools allows you to create, repair and modify simple weapons and gear, Advanced and Expert kits allow you to fix better and better weapons and armor. Gunsmithing kits allow you to create your own ammo, and Drugmaking lets you create medical items.
